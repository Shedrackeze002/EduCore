#
# Renders every video of each unit that is not finished yet, one video at a time, and uploads a
# unit to Google Drive once all of its videos are finished. A video counts as finished when its
# build succeeds (it leaves video/out/<id>/.rendered). A session restart stops background jobs,
# so the same command run again picks up at the first unfinished video. Delete a video's
# .rendered file to render it again. The upload skips files Drive already has.
#
# RENDER_MINUTES=110 stops cleanly, between videos, before that many minutes have passed (a video
# takes about six), so a job run under a time limit never loses a video half-made.
